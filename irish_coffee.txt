INGREDIENTS

1 ½ ounces Irish whiskey (that’s 3 tablespoons/I used Jameson)
1 to 2 teaspoons maple syrup, to taste
6 ounces hot freshly brewed coffee (that’s ¾ cup/use your favorite roast)
Whipped cream, for topping


INSTRUCTIONS
1. Pour the whiskey and 1 teaspoon maple syrup into a heat-safe mug. Pour in a splash of the coffee and stir with a spoon until the maple syrup dissolves into the coffee.
2. Pour in the rest of the coffee. Taste, and stir in additional maple syrup if you would like a sweeter drink.
3. Top with whipped cream. If your whipped cream is lightly whipped (soft peaks), you may need to pour it slowly over a spoon so it floats on top. Serve while the drink is still warm!
